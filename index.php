According to Sir Adrian Cadbury, Corporate Governance is  concerned with holding the balance between economic and social goals and between individual and commercial goals. The governance framework is there to encourage the efficient use of resources and equally to require accountability for the stewardship of those resources. The aim is to align as nearly as possible the interests of individuals, corporations and society."
